    "- Summarise the history of the box plot and situations in which it used.\n",
    "- Demonstrate the use of the box plot using data of your choosing.\n",
    "- Explain any relevant terminology such as the terms quartile and percentile.\n",

    "Box-and-whisker plot, also called boxplot or box plot, graph that summarizes numerical data based on quartiles, which divide a data set into fourths. The box-and-whisker plot is useful for revealing the central tendency and variability of a data set, the distribution (particularly symmetry or skewness) of the data, and the presence of outliers. It is also a powerful graphical technique for comparing samples from two or more different treatments or populations. It was invented in the 1970s by American statistician John Wilder Tukey [1]\n",

    "of a dataset:\n",
    "- the median,\n",
    "- two hinges, the upper and lower fourths (quartiles),\n",

    "- two whiskers that connect the hinges to the fences, and\n",
